# Finding the most repeated character(s) in a string

Simple exercise to find the most frequently occuring characters in a string. For extra credit, I've added a minimal command-line interface with a touch of recursion.

## Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:agerdes/repeated-character.git
cd repeated-character
bundle install
ruby app.rb
```
